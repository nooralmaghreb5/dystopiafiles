Goodbye 9 to 5, am I living to live.
or living blink to blink.

Good morning boss, please pay rise.
Good employee, I am, I cries.

Most of the monies I get from you is just to
serve you.

A shack, some tuna, noodles and gas queues.
Who knew?

That we would be slaves in 2026.
Track 12 explains pain and 1996.

Brave New World, ghost girl, cute curls.
Save your pearls, post twirl, flute cowgirl.

They see the drip,
I thrifted it.

Yo bitch,
Wanted it.

Took her air fryer,
then dipped.
Chicken Fingers.

scheming the gp,
codeine,
sold it to a fiend.

trapping for survival,
still reading bible.

still alive bro,
rest in peace nigel

sophie taught me plath
streets taught me strap

they anxious
they not gangstas
